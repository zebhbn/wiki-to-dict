If you gained the necessary information from Yaromir by correctly answering his question, buying the painting would later start the Avid Collector quest in which the painting can be sold on to Marcus T.K. Hodgson, a famed Novigrad book dealer, who will pay quite a tidy sum for it.
Alternatively, Geralt can hold onto the painting and display it at Corvo Bianco with the Blood and Wine expansion installed.

The latter arrived on the Continent after the Conjunction of the Spheres following the destruction of their ancestral homeworld. In the world of the Aen Elle, elves are constantly at war with unicorns. The King of the Alders, Auberon Muircetach, governed his people from the capital city of Tir ná Lia.
Their language, the Ellylon, is a variant of the Elder Speech.
A book about Aen Elle use of magic was written by Geoffrey Monck.

The sages also exhibit prophetic or oracular powers. Over the years people simplified the term, referring to them instead as "sages" or "elven mages", but this is not entirely accurate. Francesca Findabair, who sat in the Chapter, was an elf and a mage but not one of the Aen Saevherne.
For many, they are more legend than fact. Few, even among the elves, can boast of close contact with the Aen Saevherne.

Settled priests usually follow a single deity but acknowledge and respect others[1] while the wandering ones tend to invoke all the gods.[2] Some of the deities are known as the Immortal Ones.[3]
It should be noted that while most of one deity's followers believe in the existence of another one, they do not necessarily worship the latter in the same way as the primary one – and, in extreme cases, can even hate it and its followers, as in case of the persecuted Coram Agh Tera cult.[4]

Large golems fueled by the element of Fire, that is the Fire Elementals, are sometimes dubbed ifrits, but have nothing in common with the real ones.[2][3]

She had also developed quite an attachment to Alvin. She would have dearly loved to have adopted him and raise him with Julian, but Julian was not so taken with the prospect of raising a child who was, from all reports, a source.
The jealous rivalry with her sister reached a peak one day when Celina started to argue with her, near the Raspberry patch, and ended up pushing Alina down and causing Alina to hit her head on a rock, killing her instantly. Because she was murdered in this manner, Alina arised as a noonwraith, doomed to forever roam the fields.

Anna Henrietta was the ruling duchess of Toussaint, and beloved by all her people. She ruled the country with her husband Raymund until he died in 1265, two years before Geralt and his friends arrived in Toussaint, after which she ruled as the sole monarch.[3]
Her official, protocol title is "Her Enlightened Ladyship", unofficially "Her Grace" and in more casual matters outside the court she is to be referred to as "Lady Duchess." However, the Chamberlain and Marshal of the Court Sebastian Le Goff strongly advised Geralt to address her as "Your Grace" at all times. She is known to a select few by the shorter name, Anarietta.

His father was an alcoholic who repeatedly beat him, his mother and his brother. Unfortunately, one day his father was exceptionally drunk, and took it too far. He beat the life out of his brother, causing Arnjolf to murder him in retaliation. Vilified by his village, Arnjolf set off in search of a worthy death, a death to erase his shame.
He carved a bullseye marking into his forehead to help enemy archers find their mark. Alas, by the time they saw his carving, it was far too late for them.

To do this, he had Ciri, a descendant of the two lovers, brought to him and groomed to produce an heir. He was notably patient and never brutal, but nor would he be dissuaded from his goal.
He died before he was able to impregnate Ciri; killed, possibly unwittingly, possibly not, from an overdose of an aphrodisiac or performance enhancer at the age of over 650 years supplied by Eredin Bréacc Glas, who viewed himself as a more suitable ruler.

These weapons with arms strengthened with bronze plates and strung with horsehair are capable of propelling heavy bolts up to a mile away, but because of their sheer strength, the recoil of each shot causes the weapon to shift from its original position, so the same target cannot be hit on two consecutive fires. An experienced crew can cock and release two bolts each minute. It is a deadly and very costly weapon. In Nilfgaard, the cost of one of this engine is around 80 Florens.

          <dd>It was originally built by elves and later renovated by the architect, Peter Faramond. The elegance and craftsmanship of the palace shines like polished alabaster, attracting courtiers and knights from the surrounding provinces like moths to a flame. The Palace also exhibits exquisite stained glass windows, shining marble floors, and the finest corbels and column work. Inside, it boasts the largest library in the known world (not counting the university ones) and huge Knight Hall.
Despite all the work done on it, very few know it has a secret area, hidden by a powerful illusion. Originally only known by the elven builders, it was kept a secret among the few sorcerers in the ducal family and only passed down to other magical family members. Thus, none of the duchesses ever knew of it, but those like Artorius Vigo and his niece Fringilla Vigo, knew of it and used it for their own purposes.[1]

          <dd>Werebears,[1] on Skellige known as berserkers,[2] are therianthropes who transform into bears or half-bears. As other such creatures, they are hardly hurt by steel but are still very vulnerable to silver.
Like other kinds of therianthropy, the "arctanthropy" can be acquired either as a result of a curse or inherited from werebear parents. However, it is likely that a bite from a werebear does not result in the victim becoming a werebear as well.[1][3][4] That said, on the Skellige Isles, a group of Svalblod worshipers called Vildkaarls invented another, "controllable" way of becoming a berserker. After a complicated ritual involving psilocybe mushrooms and what seemed to be allowing wild bears to eat the cultists alive, the fierce warriors used to rise and spill blood in the name of their god.
The bloodlust of Svalblod worshipers and their leader, jarl Knut the Callous, ultimately led the Islanders to banish the cult and destroy the sacred sites of the werebear god.[2][5]
Werebears are exceptionally strong, even tougher and more relentless than real bears.[2] It is possible that they enjoy the company of ursines, such as werewolves stick to canines, werecats to felids and wererats to murids.[3][4]

The unit consisted of dauntless swashbucklers, interrogation specialists, noiseless scouts – all of them extremely loyal to their leader.
So far the Blue Stripes unit has suffered only one failure – they haven't managed to capture the infamous bandit Iorveth.

Actual attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious, resulting in multiple piercing injuries to the lower part of the body. Regardless, the animal is not considered dangerous enough for a witcher to be called; folks usually manage to hunt down the beast or pay crowns to a hunter for removal. The domesticated breed is called a pig.

Considered as the malicious rogues and pests, and the real scourge for miners who they tantalize and haunt by knocking the rocks, steal or destroy sidewalks, mining equipment and all possessions, sometimes even attack them but stop at a few bruises. However, miners can get at them by utilizing food and alcohol.[2]
Geralt met one knocker, a friend of Avallac'h's, in the caves beneath Mount Gorgon. The knocker helped the witcher to get to Caed Myrkvid by letting him ride on him, albeit not very smoothly.[2]
For some reason, a young bucca is often confused with a godling.[3]

She was one possible choice of guest to invite to Shani's party, though probably not a welcome one. That was all right, as it turned out that she was in love with a werewolf anyway, but she would not reveal his identity, in case Geralt decided to kill him. This left the witcher no other choice than to find out for himself.
It was not Geralt's investigation however, that revealed the werewolf's identity. A chance encounter in the restricted part of the Trade Quarter lead to the surprising discovery that Carmen's lover was none other than Vincent, captain of the City Guard. Once she realized that Geralt knew that Vincent was the werewolf, she begged him to help find a cure.
She also enjoyed a good round of dice and was a novice player herself.

After Dandelion is saved from the Temple Guard by the witcher, he renames the establishment to the Chameleon and refurbishes it into a cabaret and tavern. The end result is determined by the player through earlier dialogue choices.

Cintra (Elder Speech: Xin'trea) is one of the Northern Kingdoms, located south of Sodden, Riverdell, and the great river Yaruga.
Cintra was a very powerful kingdom in the times of Queen Calanthe, but was conquered by Nilfgaard during the First Nilfgaard War. After the Second Nilfgaard War, the kingdom was nominally an independent state, but was actually ruled by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard because of his marriage to Empress Cirilla, also known as False Ciri.
Cintra's neighbors are Sodden, Brugge, and the Nilfgaard province of Nazair. When Emhyr var Emreis proclaimed False Ciri queen, he also named her princess of Brugge, duchess of Sodden, heir of Skellige, and sovereign of Attre and Abb Yarra.

          <dd>It features the world of The Witcher and allows players to assume the role of four different characters from the franchise. These characters include Geralt of Rivia, Dandelion, Triss Merigold, and Yarpen Zigrin. Players compete in various quests, slaying monsters along the way, in order to gain the most victory points.
Each of the four characters has their own skill set, so the player can experience the world of the Witcher differently depending on which character you choose. You are sure to find a character to fit your play style, whether you prefer diplomacy to fighting, or wielding magic to relying on the help of companions. The Witcher Adventure Game provides a multitude of tactical options.

          <dd>The Conjunction of the Spheres was a cataclysm which affected the whole Multiverse and occurred 1,500 years before the events in the novels, trapping many "unnatural" creatures in this dimension, including ghouls, graveirs, and vampires. Rifts were created by the collision of many different realms, filling the world of the gnomes and dwarves with hundreds of creatures of all shapes and sizes, as well as a mystical force that came to be known as "chaos" or "magic".
Unable to manipulate the forces of magic and with little preparation to fight the monsters that came through the conjunction of the different realms, the gnomes, dwarves, and elves, as well as many other displaced races such as the vran, werebbubbs, halflings, and the first humans, were plunged into a strange, dangerous, and uncertain time period, that would last for many generations.
It was during this time that the elves say humans, or more specifically, the Dauk and Wozgor people, first appeared, their own world having been destroyed. Nordling humans settled on the Continent many hundreds of years after that, this event being called the First Landing. It can be debated whether or not the two original human civilizations were extinct by the time the Nordlings arrived on the Continent.

In a sense, all creatures, human and otherwise are containers, as are many trees, shrubs and plants which bear the herbs required for alchemical potions. They will not be dealt with individually in this section as they each have their own page anyway.
The easiest, and most reliable, way to find any containers in view is to hold down the Alt-key. This highlights all the usable items in view, a great way to find remains after a large melee.

After King Bran passed the throne to Eist Tuirseach, Crach became Jarl of Skellige, the main commander of the military forces.

He was known for sometimes showing his fiery temper as well as a healthy appetite. During his youth, he was described as a broad shouldered man with a mop of red hair. Later when he was a grown adult, his eyes were said to be hawk-like.

As he became well-known, a cult began to form around him. More and more people started following his teachings with some of them becoming his pupils, as was the case with Saint Plegmund who brought his master's words to Toussaint.[2] He was seen doing miracles, and in short time, his words and deeds converted the whole duchy along with Duchess Caroberta who ordered both a temple in Beauclair and a monument on the west bank of the Sansretour River to be built.[3][4] Lebioda himself visited Toussaint at least once to hear prayers of the faithful.
His wisdom reached even the edges of the Continent far as Kovir and Poviss where it spread thanks to King Esterad Thyssen's wife, Queen Zuleyka, who lived most of her life according to the prophet's teachings.[1][5]
He died, eaten by a dragon, which he attempted to stop harassing Kaedweni villagers near Ban Ard. The remains of the prophet, recovered from the feces of the creature, were collected by his students and interned in the sarcophagus in the Novigrad's Great Temple. On some holidays, the faithful are allowed to kiss the relic.[6]
He is not only revered by humans but also by several assimilated dwarves.[7]
Even the Cult of the Eternal Fire follows some of Lebioda's parables.[8]

          <dd>Deidre Ademyne was Eskel's surprise child. She became Eskel's "Unexpected Child", as Vesemir put it, when the witcher saved her father's, then the prince of Caingorn, life. In gratitude, the prince promised Eskel "that which he would find but did not expect" when he returned home. This, as it turned out was the pregnancy of his wife, and therefore Deidre. Because of this Eskel and the girl shared a special bond. For example, Deidre said that she needed to only think of Eskel to know exactly where he was at any given time. She said they are bound by Destiny.
Deidre was first in line to inherit the titles of her recently deceased father. It appeared the elder Ademeyn succumbed to syphilis. The second in line, her brother, Merwin Ademeyn, a nobleman on King Henselt's council, did not want her to rule as he believed she was not fit. He seemed quite willing to make sure she would not have the crown, enlisting the help of a powerful sorceress.
The sorceress, Sabrina Glevissig, said Deidre had been affected by the Curse of the Black Sun. Sabrina wanted to kill the princess as well to examine her body and discover the "truth" about the Black Sun for the Council of Mages.
Deidre was born during an eclipse, and this is why she was considered to be affected by the so-called Curse of the Black Sun. She appeared completely normal, but she did emit an aura which had apparently been increasing in power over the years. This aura prevented magic from being used in her presence, and this included witchers' signs as well as spells cast by other magic users. Deidre herself said that her aura also dispelled previously cast spells when she was present.
From Merwin, we heard a sad tale from Deidre's childhood. It seemed that at the age of 12 she was raped by a charlatan claiming to be a mage. Actually, he claimed to be an altogether different kind of specialist: an oneiromancer, or diviner of dreams. This "mage" claimed that he needed to spend a night in Deidre's chamber as she slept. He would mix a brew designed to amplify her dreams. The old man could barely walk, had a beard down to his waist... Deidre's family suspected nothing.
He seemed to do as he claimed he would. By morning he was gone, but several valuable items had also disappeared from Deidre's chamber, including her favorite mother of pearl comb... Only the laundresses in the outskirts saw the miscreant, claiming that he fled as if chased by demons.
The prince ordered a search, but it was too late. Her father, who had hired the mage, refused to believe her claims of rape, saying that the cheat was an old man... And the bed linens betrayed nothing... This caused Deidre to flee assisted by "a young stable boy described as "an excessively broad-shouldered oaf". This could have been Roben, a man later described as a lover of both Deidre and Sabrina Glevissig, depending on whom you believe.
A search party was organized to find the youngsters, but they had disappeared without a trace. A week later, folk inhabiting the area where he was found claimed to have seen a young girl and boy ride through on large wolves... the stuff of fairy tales. The charlatan was ultimately found dead, having had his "manhood" removed. The implication being, of course that Deidre exacted her revenge most violently.
After some time passed, Deidre returned to the castle. From then on her father ordered the dogs set upon any mages that approached, assuming that any true sorcerer would surely manage to avoid a few bear-hunting hounds... And then Sabrina appeared.
Deidre can be found inside the walls of Kaer Morhen where the witchers have taken her in. She camps in the inner courtyard, accompanied by her faithful companions, Beann'shie and D'yaebl.

The author invented the language for orcs and elves,[2] but so far only the latter have appeared in the official continuity.
For the purpose of Netflix's The Witcher, renowned linguist David J. Peterson recreated the Elder Speech as a fully developed constructed language. In contrast with Sapkowski's writings, Peterson's latinization of the language reflects the intended pronunciation, leaving the irregularities to the language's native script (which he had also invented). For example, inváerne is latinized as inveirne and Hen Llinge as Hen Linge.[3]

Other than regular criminals and thieves, political dissidents are captured and detained here.

Among these are the Baroness Mary Louisa and her son Aryan.
Geralt of Rivia has also been held and handcuffed in one cell of the dungeons. At the beginning of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, the reason for his captivity is unknown until Vernon Roche enters the cell to question him.

An adult dwarf grows as tall as a human male's chest. They are more sturdy than humans, which makes them tougher and stronger. They usually grow long beards. Dwarves are often excellent soldiers, artisans and businessmen. While they tend to be uncouth, they are also jolly and cheerful.
The motherland of dwarves is Mahakam. Like other nonhumans, dwarves are often persecuted by Nordlings. Because of that, some dwarves were members of the Scoia'tael guerrilla allied with Nilfgaard during the empire's invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. These dwarves distinguished themselves from their brethren by wearing their beards in plaits.

The author invented the language for orcs and elves,[2] but so far only the latter have appeared in the official continuity.
For the purpose of Netflix's The Witcher, renowned linguist David J. Peterson recreated the Elder Speech as a fully developed constructed language. In contrast with Sapkowski's writings, Peterson's latinization of the language reflects the intended pronunciation, leaving the irregularities to the language's native script (which he had also invented). For example, inváerne is latinized as inveirne and Hen Llinge as Hen Linge.[3]

          <dd>Elves are one of the humanoid races that inhabit the Continent. Forming a major part of the Elder Races (along with dwarves and gnomes), those known as Aen Seidhe came to the Continent on their white ships much earlier than humans, but later than the other Elder Races. They live much longer than humans and are usually very attractive.
Elves are capable of interbreeding with humans (thus producing half-elves and quarter-elves) and dryads. Though elves are incredibly long lived, only young elves are fertile, thus elven populations tend to reproduce at a slower rate than humans.[5]
Like other nonhumans, elves are often persecuted by Nordlings. Because of that, many elves were members of the Scoia'tael guerrillas allied with Nilfgaard during the empire's second invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. In return, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis gave the elves a state of their own in Dol Blathanna and made Enid an Gleanna its queen.
Elves believe that they were created, unlike humans, who evolved. For this reason, some elves consider humans to be little more than hairless apes. Aside from Aen Seidhe, there exists another group of elves called Aen Elle that inhabits another world.

Eskel and the White Wolf were like brothers. Side by side they grew up, enjoyed pastime activities and endured the Trials. A good friend of younger Lambert and Coën of Poviss, Eskel saw Vesemir as both a mentor and a father figure. He returned to Kaer Morhen each winter to swap tales and rejuvenate for The Path.

The first 2 letters of the filenames indicate the language version.
To extract the information, first off use Gibbed Red Tools to decode them then view/edit them with a .xml editor such as Notepad++. It's easy, but the file structure is a little different than a simple .xml file.
For images, the extracted files are mostly in the globals\gui\icons\items folder, in .dds format, so a program which can open this format and convert them to .png is useful. One such free program is GIMP.

          <dd>Philippa Eilhart (Polish: Filippa Eilhart) was King Vizimir's advisor and remained in Redania's court even after his death, for which she was likely responsible. She was one of the few sorceresses able to polymorph, and was thought to be "no less than three hundred years old" by 1267.[3]
She led the Thanedd coup against the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, intending to neutralize suspected traitors allied with Nilfgaard. Later, she helped found the Lodge of Sorceresses and is considered its leader.
She was one of the victims of the Witch Hunts, having been tortured and killed by Archpriest Willemer's men. Many years later, she was exonerated and canonized as Martyr Saint.

Margot is not for hire but will engage in conversation and is peripherally involved in a couple of quests; several of her employees are also unavailable. The whores Geralt can hire at any time number three or four: Arnesse and Julia are always conversing just on the left as you enter the main door, and a third randomly-named woman in a red cap (smaller than Arnesse's) - there is sometimes a pair of this last model, usually with a different name for each.
The four or five whores Geralt can't hire all have randomly determined names, and all have longer dark or dark-red hair (one elf model and two humans).
The larger room on the upper floor of the inn also appears to be part of the brothel, owing to the same style of furnishings and presence of one or more ladies in typical attire: one standing on the balcony overlooking the town square, others sleeping inside while not on duty. (And also owing to the presence of Derae and/or Margot towards the end of the chapter.)

          <dd>Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.
During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.
Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him.[1] He, therefore, became a true knight.

In addition, they can be learned by alchemical experimentation during meditation and subsequent usage with exception of fisstech which requires only experimentation.

The thick city walls have never been breached, as they were tactfully designed by the architects of the Oxenfurt Academy.
Novigrad is inhabited by an unusually colorful group of both permanent residents and those in town on long and short-term visits. Most eye-catching amidst the throngs of common townsfolk, stall-keepers, and craftsmen are those practicing the more roguish professions. There is no army in the city but it does have a secret service, an ever-present Temple Guard, and a powerful Temple Fleet.

In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him.[1] He, therefore, became a true knight.

Despite their prowess, gladiators are never used during battles for two reasons; first, an unwritten custom forbids such things as unethical and against the rules of honest warfare. Second, while good in the arena, gladiators wouldn't do good listening to commands and standing in formation.[1]
As the contact with the Empire has some huge cultural influence on Nordlings, terms "gladiator" and "gladiator fights" are used in Kaedwen as well. The first stands for a non-knight arena-fighting professional and the second for army tournaments.[2]

The thick city walls have never been breached, as they were tactfully designed by the architects of the Oxenfurt Academy.
Novigrad is inhabited by an unusually colorful group of both permanent residents and those in town on long and short-term visits. Most eye-catching amidst the throngs of common townsfolk, stall-keepers, and craftsmen are those practicing the more roguish professions. There is no army in the city but it does have a secret service, an ever-present Temple Guard, and a powerful Temple Fleet.

          <dd>In general, kill as many monsters as you can, even if it means lurking in dangerous places. You have swallow potions, so make the most of them! And if you run out, brew some more! For each level Geralt advances, the experience points (XP) you get per monster are reduced by 5 XP and the XP you require to reach the next level increases by 1000 points. This means that killing foes sooner than later is more beneficial. Only your patience (or lack thereof) limits the amount of experience points you can rack up.
Another obvious exploit is the way the game handles the passage of time. Because it does not actually affect gameplay, quests can be put off indefinitely while you rack up additional experience points. Below is a chapter-by-chapter guide on how to earn that extra XP:
Be forewarned that any XP you gain from killing monsters depends on your level at the time, so any deviation from the numbers mentioned below is perfectly normal.

Special thanks go to Licensed Luny for the many, many hours of research so tirelessly put in, all in aid of those few witchers who are illiterate either by choice or circumstance.
What if your poor witcher never learned to read ? How would he get along? Thankfully, not all information must come from print sources. Here is a little guide which lets you know just what sort of information Geralt can get without reading books or scrolls. All these journal entries are obtained either by speaking with various and sundry NPCs, or by using found items like previously unknown oils, potions and bombs thus revealing their formulae.

The game is about the clash of two armies locked in mortal struggle on a battlefield where the players are the leaders and the cards their forces. With four different factions offering unique combat styles and endless paths to victory, Gwent is every adventurer's first choice when it comes to one-on-one card-based dueling.
Take risks and think on your feet, strategize and deliver cunning combos, use potent magic and mighty hero cards and be the last one standing on the field of honor![1]
On June 15, 2016 CD Projekt announced the development of a stand-alone Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. GWENT will be available at release for Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4 as a free to play game that puts you, not your cards, in the center of the action.[2]

          <dd>Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.
During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.
Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him.[1] He, therefore, became a true knight.

Havekar are looked upon with contempt by both humans and elves. They tended to be primarily human, but their membership does include some assimilated elves and dwarves. They appear in Baptism of Fire, the third novel in the Blood of Elves saga.

He will stand on Bifröst, the Rainbow Bridge, and blow his horn to signal that it is time to take up arms and fight against specters of Chaos from Mörhogg.[2]
Several stories also connect him to Freya, the goddess of fertility and beauty. One of these stories claims that he is her son while another makes Hemdall her favorite and lover.[3]
However, a goddess that is widely accepted by all people of Skellige as a summer lover of Hemdall is Heulyn, who reportedly bore him six sons that became heroes in their own rights and founded the reigning clans. The sons were Grymmdjarr, Tyr, Broddr, Modolf, Otkell and Sove and the clans Clan an Craite, Clan Tuirseach, Clan Dimun, Clan Drummond, Clan Heymaey and Clan Brokvar respectively.[1]

The two basic verbs, "to be" and "to have", are borrowed from Italian and Latin.[1]
The author invented the language for orcs and elves,[2] but so far only the latter have appeared in the official continuity.
For the purpose of Netflix's The Witcher, renowned linguist David J. Peterson recreated the Elder Speech as a fully developed constructed language. In contrast with Sapkowski's writings, Peterson's latinization of the language reflects the intended pronunciation, leaving the irregularities to the language's native script (which he had also invented). For example, inváerne is latinized as inveirne and Hen Llinge as Hen Linge.[3]

Anna Henrietta was the ruling duchess of Toussaint, and beloved by all her people. She ruled the country with her husband Raymund until he died in 1265, two years before Geralt and his friends arrived in Toussaint, after which she ruled as the sole monarch.[3]
Her official, protocol title is "Her Enlightened Ladyship", unofficially "Her Grace" and in more casual matters outside the court she is to be referred to as "Lady Duchess." However, the Chamberlain and Marshal of the Court Sebastian Le Goff strongly advised Geralt to address her as "Your Grace" at all times. She is known to a select few by the shorter name, Anarietta.

          <dd>The Holy Grail makes at least two appearances in the Witcher series. A precious chalice made of milky opal was found by gnome Percival Schuttenbach on the top of mountain Montsalvat. In the short story "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna (short story)", the young knight Galahad mysteriously appears from the mists searching for the grail, only to wind up an unexpected guest at Geralt and Yennefer's wedding.

Boasting from the lower ranks to the higher nobles involved within the military, its soldiers, known as the black-clad[1], are well-versed in the art of combat. Under the complete control of the Nilfgaardian Imperator who leads it through a set of high-ranking officers under a Field marshal.[2]
During greater conquests and invasions, such as the Northern Wars, the army was divided into groups, such as Center Army Group, East Army Group and Verden Operations Group. During the second of the Northern Wars, the army count was ca. 320,000, with 300,000 attacking the kingdoms and about 20,000 remaining in the Empire to keep the peace and defend core provinces in case of an unexpected turn in war.[3]
Like many other armies, The Imperial Army is also in possession of siege weapons, including mangonels, Trebuchets, Zerrikanian fire scorpions, and rot tossers.[4][5]
Unlike the Northern Kingdoms, slavery is commonplace among the Nilfgaardians; slaves, usually prisoners of war, are used not only for manual work, but even during combat, fighting for their freedom, at least according to their masters.
The army uses variety of soldiers like light and heavy cavalry, spearmen, pikemen, archers and crossbowmen.

Even though he was always extremely proud of his race, Iorweth's clothes were a combination of elven and human clothing. He didn't acquire them all at once but rather stack it up with useful pieces from armors of humans he killed.[1]
Iorweth and Isengrim Faoiltiarna were supposedly the only two who survived the massacre of the Vrihedd Brigade at the Ravine of the Hydra, following the peace of Cintra.

He was a key player in the events at Thanedd Island and later was responsible for the capture of Cahir, who was wanted under the belief that the knight knowingly gave a false Ciri before trying to hide.
Isengrim took later part in the Battle of Brenna where he was in charge of the Vrihedd Brigade with the Colonel rank.
After the Second Nilfgaard War's end, as a condition of the Peace of Cintra, 32 elven commanders that fought under the Nilfgaardian banner were captured and surrendered to the Northern Kingdoms, including Isengrim. The prisoners were later brought to Dillingen in order to execute them. Unlike his mates, Isengrim managed to escape and fled to the foot of the Elskerdeg Pass, where he met with Sigismund Dijkstra and Boreas Mun, both fugitives for their own reasons. The three of them formed an unlikely traveling party, heading East, towards Zerrikania or even Haakland, presumably leaving the territories of the Nilfgaard Empire and the Northern Kingdoms for good.

His younger daughter, out of many other women, was rejected by emperor Emhyr var Emreis, so the emperor could marry the false Ciri. Because of that, he and Stefan Skellen formed with other nobles a conspiracy to overthrow Emhyr and put Morvran Voorhis on the Nilfgaardian throne. Emhyr found out about this conspiracy from the traitor, Berengar Leuvaarden, however the sources are saying that Morvran Voorhis became the successor of Emhyr after all. Duke de Wett led his army in the decrepitude way, and his troops treated the Nordling civilians in very cruel way. He caused an uprising in Verden and king Ervyll of Verden, who was collaborating with Nilfgaard, was dethroned. He was slowing down the offensive in III phase of invasion and blocked, by that, the Middle Army, in the long term that was the main cause of the defeat of Nilfgaardian armies in the battle of Brenna. He was sentenced to death by Emhyr var Emreis either for his failures either for attempting to overthrow him.[1]

Dominik Bombastus Houvenaghel was one of his faithful counselors and the emperor even granted him with titles of burgrave and zupparius salis of Venendal.[5]

The castle can only be reached by "The Witchers Trail", which is easy to miss, and encircles the keep. It is often given the nickname "The Killer" by young witchers.

The player must instead run away from the Queen and use the Aard sign to first collapse the passage to slow down the queen and then use it to destroy the supports of the Salamandra Cave, which will bring down the section on top of the Kikimore and cause its death. However, experienced witchers fight the Kikimore Queen using the Brown Oil, Quen, and Aard signs. Bombs like the Devil's Puffball and the Dragon's Dream are also effective as well. Arguably the most easy method is by using Yeden with Cripling Sign unlocked, see The Unforgiven article for details. You can then retrieve the Professor's remains and acquire the Kikimore Queen's nerve that can be used to make the Kikimore's Ire potion.
Be careful when breaking the tunnel supports, standing too close will cause the rocks to collapse on top of you and kill you.

In practice, however, each ruler preferred to keep to his clan's seat, and Kaer Almhult was left unused. Eventually the decision was made to turn the structure into a prison.

The Northern Kingdoms were invaded and partially conquered by the Nilfgaardian Empire.
During the Third Northern War, only King Radovid V of Redania remained of all the crowned heads of the major kingdoms. For this reason, during this war the Northern Kingdoms were known as Radovid's Realms.

The thick city walls have never been breached, as they were tactfully designed by the architects of the Oxenfurt Academy.
Novigrad is inhabited by an unusually colorful group of both permanent residents and those in town on long and short-term visits. Most eye-catching amidst the throngs of common townsfolk, stall-keepers, and craftsmen are those practicing the more roguish professions. There is no army in the city but it does have a secret service, an ever-present Temple Guard, and a powerful Temple Fleet.

They inhabit various adits, grooves, precipices, chasms, dark cavities, burrows, delves, grottos, caverns and rocky heaths. Their existence in the area is always evidence for the presence of wealth hidden in the ground, such as ores, minerals, salt or petroleum. Considered as the malicious rogues and pests, and the real scourge for miners who they tantalize and haunt by knocking the rocks, steal or destroy sidewalks, mining equipment and all possessions, sometimes even attack them but stop at a few bruises. However, miners can get at them by utilizing food and alcohol.[2]
Geralt met one knocker, a friend of Avallac'h's, in the caves beneath Mount Gorgon. The knocker helped the witcher to get to Caed Myrkvid by letting him ride on him, albeit not very smoothly.[2]
For some reason, a young bucca is often confused with a godling.[3]

From the 8th into the 14th century, Common Speech was considered the most widespread language[2], from Kovir and Poviss in the north, all the way down to Ebbing. By the 16th century though, it is considered an endangered or even dead language.[3]

The Law dictates that a man saved by another is expected to offer to his savior a boon whose nature is unknown to one or both parties. In most cases, the boon takes the form of the saved man's firstborn child, conceived or born without the father's knowledge.
Ciri came to be Geralt's ward after he invoked the Law of Surprise on Duny and Pavetta. Geralt demanded that which Duny already had, but did not know of. This, Geralt revealed, was Duny's child, carried, unknown to Duny but known to Geralt, by Pavetta. Highlighting the destiny of the relationship between Geralt and Ciri, he claims her a second time when he invokes the Law of Surprise on a traveling merchant he saves from monsters during a random encounter. The merchant is unaware that his wife has taken Ciri into their home as a war orphan.

His wisdom reached even the edges of the Continent far as Kovir and Poviss where it spread thanks to King Esterad Thyssen's wife, Queen Zuleyka, who lived most of her life according to the prophet's teachings.[1][5]
He died, eaten by a dragon, which he attempted to stop harassing Kaedweni villagers near Ban Ard. The remains of the prophet, recovered from the feces of the creature, were collected by his students and interned in the sarcophagus in the Novigrad's Great Temple. On some holidays, the faithful are allowed to kiss the relic.[6]
He is not only revered by humans but also by several assimilated dwarves.[7]
Even the Cult of the Eternal Fire follows some of Lebioda's parables.[8]

          <dd>Leo Bonhart (d. 1268) was a bounty hunter and previously a professional soldier from Ebbing. Known for his professionalism and expense to hire, he found pleasure in watching brutal scenes and inflicting pain on others. He was described as very tall but ghoulishly thin, with a prodigious grey moustache. He was said to have cold, expressionless eyes which were often likened to fish.
He possessed three witcher medallions, depicting the heads of a wolf (School of the Wolf), a cat (School of the Cat) and a griffin (School of the Griffin), and claimed to have killed their previous owners. A claim which was not necessarily in doubt, given his prowess with a sword.
Bonhart was hired by Stefan Skellen to kill Ciri and by Baron of Casadei to capture her alive. Bonhart killed the Rats band to which Ciri belonged and cut off their heads after their deaths. He neither killed Ciri, nor brought her to Baron of Casadei, therefore fulfilling neither of his contracts. He imprisoned her for some time, beating her and drugging her with fisstech. After some time he also bought Ciri her infamous sword Zireael and forced her to kill in the arena at Claremont, which belonged to his cousin Houvenaghel.
Ciri escaped Bonhart with the help of Neratin Ceka while they were in the village of Unicorn. Bonhart had gone there to meet with Skellen and Rience. Bonhart then killed Neratin Ceka while Skellen seriously wounded Ciri with an orion as she escaped with her horse, Kelpie. Later, Ciri hid and healed at the hermitage of Vysogota of Corvo in the Pereplut swamp.
Together with Skellen and Rience, Bonhart tried to hunt her down on Vilgefortz's order. Eventually, she escaped to Tor Zireael.
At Stygga Castle, Bonhart killed Cahir, and then he himself died at the sword of Ciri.

          <dd>Werewolves are therianthropes who transform into wolves or half-wolves.[1] As other such creatures, they are hardly hurt by steel but very vulnerable to silver.
There are two most common ways to aquire lycanthropy: the first one through a curse[2] and the second is to simply have a werewolf parent.[1][3] Being bitten by another werewolf, while popular in folk tales, gives only a very small chance of becoming one in reality.[2] Those who are born as werewolves are able to fully control their shapeshifting abilities,[1][3] while those cursed or bitten change into their werewolf form only during the full moon.[2] Those who became werewolves during their lives however are the only ones who can be cured.[3] The wolfsbane is said to mitigate the illness' symptoms.
Therianthropy diseases, including lycanthropy, appeared in the world after the Conjunction of the Spheres, affecting nonhuman and early human populations alike.[2] According to Herbolth, lands in the Toina valley, also called the Dogbane, were plagued by werewolves before the Nordling colonization.[4]
Werewolves have a legendary sense of smell, exceptional even amongst real wolves.[1] Lycanthropes are usually on good terms with other canines and, as one would expect, hate werecats.[2]

When the Order of the Flaming Rose basically took over the district he lived in, he became a friend with one of its knights, Siegfried of Denesle, who later on mentioned Maarloeve to witcher Geralt when the former was looking to take down Salamandra and Azar Javed.

          <dd>A mage, also sometimes called wizard, sorcerer, or sorceress, is a person skilled and educated in the use of magic. Only rare individuals have the potential to become mages and many of those with this potential are doomed to madness. Unless the individual in question - known as a source - learns to control their power quickly, he or she may end up a half-insane, slobbering oracle. That is why schools of sorcery were created, where talented children study for many years, acquiring knowledge and mastering magical skills. Because of their powers, mages age more slowly than ordinary people.
They can extract magical energy from the four elements, transport themselves long distances and heal, as well as kill, in the blink of an eye. They have extensive scientific and political knowledge; in the latter respect, many mages are the equals of rulers.
The word "mage" is used mostly to refer to people trained in magical academies like Aretuza or Ban Ard and is rarely used to refer to magic-wielding druids or priests (especially the latter, since they claim to be given their powers by the gods).
In the Witcher saga, mages are also heavily involved in politics and are well organized. In the beginning there was the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, which was later replaced by the Lodge of Sorceresses.

          <dd>A fresh mandrake is considered so toxic that the earth surrounding one is poisoned by the plant and that even breathing in the fumes or sprinkling the fresh juice onto a cut hand can have fatal consequences. At the very least, even if one doesn't die from it, the toxin secreted by the root causes powerful hallucinogenic effects. As such, care is taken to use a mask and gloves to pick them.[1]
Notable among mandrake's many alchemical uses is its use in the potion that maintains the longevity of sorcerers, preventing further ageing (but not restoring lost youth).[2]

They are said to somehow use the poison of the Bohun Upas and have an appetite that allows them to eat as many as 20 people per moon. Scholars at the Oxenfurt Academy believe that manticores have three rows of teeth, though this is not proven. Manticore's claws also never stop growing, so scratching various surfaces helps to keep them short.[1]

If Geralt managed to reveal his betrayal, Constable John Natalis arrested him immediately. Provided that Geralt also revealed Baron Kimbolt's plan to kill Boussy, the witcher was awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service to Temeria. Despite this, Natalis only arrested Maravel as he didn't have the manpower to control both men's armies.

Later on, during the "Hung Over" quest, she recounts to Geralt what happened during the night at the brothel, while Roche's men and he were drunk.
You can commonly find her in the first room on the right after entering the brothel, on the lower level of the inn.
If he loots her room, Geralt also find some notes. It turns out that not only does Margot have suspicions about Síle de Tansarville, but that she is a Scoia'tael collaborator too.
Margot likes to peep at people through a hole in the wall of her lover Derae's room. While this is not a nice habit, it turns out to be very helpful when Geralt looks for Triss, at the end of Chapter I.
If Geralt gives Iorveth his sword in Chapter I during "The Assassins of Kings", Margot later offers him a letter to Iorveth. If he does not return Iorveth's sword, Margot kills herself and you can read her intentions in a farewell letter.

For each level Geralt advances, the experience points (XP) you get per monster are reduced by 5 XP and the XP you require to reach the next level increases by 1000 points. This means that killing foes sooner than later is more beneficial. Only your patience (or lack thereof) limits the amount of experience points you can rack up.
Another obvious exploit is the way the game handles the passage of time. Because it does not actually affect gameplay, quests can be put off indefinitely while you rack up additional experience points. Below is a chapter-by-chapter guide on how to earn that extra XP:
Be forewarned that any XP you gain from killing monsters depends on your level at the time, so any deviation from the numbers mentioned below is perfectly normal.

The easiest way to get these entries is to just read the book that contains the entries you need. If you are a cheapskate, then there is some added complexity to getting the entries you need with minimum cash outlay. If money is no object, just buy all the books you need. There is always a merchant selling books, no matter where you are (and buying the ones you have read).
Boss monsters do not require a pre-existing Bestiary entry to extract the special ingredients.

Disgusted with the atrocities Morkvarg committed against the gods by defiling the garden, Einar transformed Morkvarg into a Werewolf using a cursed wolf pendant given to him by his father. The curse not only bound him to the garden for eternity, it also gave him an immense hunger that no food or prey could ever satisfy as it immediately turns to ash. Even trying to consume his own flesh would cause him incredible pain. If he is killed, he invariably is resurrected and returns to the garden where the cycle begins anew.

Persons who embrace the Nilfgaardian way of life, but do not have Lower Alban ancestry, are sometimes called Nilfgaardized, e.g. Nilfgaardized Gemmerans.

During greater conquests and invasions, such as the Northern Wars, the army was divided into groups, such as Center Army Group, East Army Group and Verden Operations Group. During the second of the Northern Wars, the army count was ca. 320,000, with 300,000 attacking the kingdoms and about 20,000 remaining in the Empire to keep the peace and defend core provinces in case of an unexpected turn in war.[3]
Like many other armies, The Imperial Army is also in possession of siege weapons, including mangonels, Trebuchets, Zerrikanian fire scorpions, and rot tossers.[4][5]
Unlike the Northern Kingdoms, slavery is commonplace among the Nilfgaardians; slaves, usually prisoners of war, are used not only for manual work, but even during combat, fighting for their freedom, at least according to their masters.
The army uses variety of soldiers like light and heavy cavalry, spearmen, pikemen, archers and crossbowmen.

It should be noted that while most of one deity's followers believe in the existence of another one, they do not necessarily worship the latter in the same way as the primary one – and, in extreme cases, can even hate it and its followers, as in case of the persecuted Coram Agh Tera cult.[4]

The thick city walls have never been breached, as they were tactfully designed by the architects of the Oxenfurt Academy.
Novigrad is inhabited by an unusually colorful group of both permanent residents and those in town on long and short-term visits. Most eye-catching amidst the throngs of common townsfolk, stall-keepers, and craftsmen are those practicing the more roguish professions. There is no army in the city but it does have a secret service, an ever-present Temple Guard, and a powerful Temple Fleet.

          <dd>Its vocabulary is based heavily on the Celtic languages of Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, although in some cases Sapkowski has used also connotations with more "popular" languages, like German and English. The two basic verbs, "to be" and "to have", are borrowed from Italian and Latin.[1]
The author invented the language for orcs and elves,[2] but so far only the latter have appeared in the official continuity.
For the purpose of Netflix's The Witcher, renowned linguist David J. Peterson recreated the Elder Speech as a fully developed constructed language. In contrast with Sapkowski's writings, Peterson's latinization of the language reflects the intended pronunciation, leaving the irregularities to the language's native script (which he had also invented). For example, inváerne is latinized as inveirne and Hen Llinge as Hen Linge.[3]

Time has not stopped here, either, and the rocks and rubble have cut off some of the passages. Alas, some of the dead refuse to remain that way, and wraiths, vampires and necrophages of all kinds eagerly greet anyone who sets a foot inside.
But even those did not stop Salamandra from sneaking in to claim this no-man's-land for their own, and letting the mutants, the results of their experiments conducted in the laboratory, run loose.
Depending on the path Geralt has chosen at this point, he will enter the catacombs with the help of either Yaevinn, Siegfried or Triss and the entrance itself will vary (see the map below). There are also strategically locked doors or caved-in areas which force the witcher take a particular (a unique) path from his start point to his ultimate goal: the laboratory.

At first, knights were mostly based and organized in the kingdoms of Aedirn and Temeria but later, after the uprising in Vizima, King Foltest confiscated the Order's assets in his dominion to finance repairs and they were forced to move further north to Redania and even Kaedwen.
The primary purposes of the Order are to defend the downtrodden from evil and spread the belief in the Eternal Fire,[2][3] but they also serve as a police force or an iron fist to hunt down heretics.[4] Before the death of the first Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg, defending the needy extended to killing monsters for free as well but after reforms, they had less time to do that.

At this time many members of the Order, including Count Falwick of Moën, served Prince Hereward of Ellander, and thus gained a lot of influence and respect there, and a number of locals like Arthur Tailles joined in and took vows.[1]
After the wars with the Nilfgaardian Empire and the death of Grand Master Rudolf Valaris, the order was dying and so a new charismatic leader, Jacques de Aldersberg, established a new order on the old, calling it the Order of the Flaming Rose. His aim was to protect the people from monsters and other evils, as well as to promote the belief in the Eternal Fire.[3]

That "Book" seems to be a copy of the Physiologus.
It seems Giancardi Molnar also had a copy of the Physiologus in his bank in Gors Velen. He gave it to Ciri to read; to keep her busy as he discussed important matters with Yennefer.

The valley is the bread basket of the Northern Kingdoms, an agricultural superzone, producing most of the food, wine and other foodthat the surrounding people consume. It is also in a strategic location between the borders of the four major realms.
As a consequence, the mutual pursuits of resource access and strategic territorial gains often produce conflict, resulting in constant invasions. Many refugees from Aedirn fled through the valley towards Temeria and Redania during the wars with Nilfgaard. Recently, it has become a for war between Kaedwen and Aedirn once again, as it has in recent memory been shifting hands.
In the books and games, the Pontar Valley belongs to Aedirn, but this was seized from Kaedwen 300 years ago. This is under dispute in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings where King Henselt marched unsuccessfully against Aedirn three years ago (in the video game continuity) and is back again, this time against Saskia and her voluntary militia.

          <dd>Poor Fucking Infantry, or PFI, was an infantry division consisting of conscripts and volunteers that lacked any relevant combat, riding, or archery experience. It was formed in Vizima during the war with Nilfgaard and it was there where Jarre and Melfi joined its ranks.
Every member of the division had tied a bundle of hay to their right leg and one of straw to their left one; The reason for this bizarre practice was since all the members were mostly illiterate and ignorant farmers who didn't discern the left from the right, for the sergeant who trained the unit only had to simply say  "Straw, Hay, Straw..." instead of "Left, Right, Left..." during the marches.
The PFI took part in the Battle of Brenna under the command of the voivode Bronibor. Initially held in reserve, it was assigned to stop the counter-charge of the Nilfgaardian Nauzicaa and 7th Daerlan brigades. Consisting primarily of inexperienced pike-men matched against the enemy's cavalry the PFI sustained heavy casualties in the clash, Bronibor included. It did manifest a surprising valor however and managed to hold its ground.
The Infantry equipment included : Chain shirt, tabard, pike, helmet and dagger.

This is not to suggest that he was not perfectly happy killing innocent bystanders and just plain anyone he felt like. He seemed to have issues with the power arrangements.
When Geralt finds himself unexpectedly incarcerated at the beginning of Chapter II, it turns out that the Professor is one of his fellow inmates, but not for long. The Professor was bailed out of jail by persons unknown, leaving Geralt to stew, but not before taunting him a little, as bad guys do. Their second encounter comes at the end of Chapter II when the witcher must again face him and Azar Javed. Their third encounter is their last. It is the Professor's second last encounter with anyone or anything. His last rendezvous is with a hungry kikimore queen.

They inhabit various adits, grooves, precipices, chasms, dark cavities, burrows, delves, grottos, caverns and rocky heaths. Their existence in the area is always evidence for the presence of wealth hidden in the ground, such as ores, minerals, salt or petroleum. Considered as the malicious rogues and pests, and the real scourge for miners who they tantalize and haunt by knocking the rocks, steal or destroy sidewalks, mining equipment and all possessions, sometimes even attack them but stop at a few bruises. However, miners can get at them by utilizing food and alcohol.[2]
Geralt met one knocker, a friend of Avallac'h's, in the caves beneath Mount Gorgon. The knocker helped the witcher to get to Caed Myrkvid by letting him ride on him, albeit not very smoothly.[2]
For some reason, a young bucca is often confused with a godling.[3]

Skellige then became a monarchy and so the king needed his official seat.[3] For this purpose a castle was built on a small island northwest of Ard Skellig and south of Spikeroog, named Kaer Almhult. In practice, however, each ruler preferred to keep to his clan's seat, and Kaer Almhult was left unused. Eventually the decision was made to turn the structure into a prison. From there, it became the lair of a band of outlaws.

          <dd>The two issues were released in May and June 2011 by Egmont, and were written by Michał Gałek, illustrated by Arkadiusz Klimek and colored by Łukasz Poller. It is not related to the previous comic book series by Maciej Parowski and Bogusław Polch. However, the following Dark Horse Comics series is set in the same video game-based continuity as Reasons of State.
If one registers a copy of The Witcher 2 game on GOG.com, then a free English version of the comics becomes available for download. An interactive version of the comic is also available for iOS devices, requiring iOS 4.3 or later. It's compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.

          <dd>Radovid V the Stern (Polish: Radowid V Srogi) was the king of Redania from the Redanian Dynasty in the last quarter of the 13th century. His reign became, along with witch hunts, one of the defining factors of the post-war period that followed the Peace of Cintra. Radovid was a polarizing figure: a brilliant strategist and a superb general by some, a paranoid madman by others. There were also many who took the middle view of his policies being harsh but justified.
He inherited his titles and estates as the only son of King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore. His two older sisters were Dalimira and Milena. Even though his father died in 1267, Prince Radovid didn't succeed him immediately because he was only twelve at the time and for several years the kingdom was governed by a Regency Council under influential Duke Nitert and Count Sigismund Dijkstra, the then-spymaster of Redanian Secret Service.
Radovid bore a deep aversion towards mages that stemmed from his father being secretly assassinated by an unknown elf at the behest of the sorceress advisor Philippa Eilhart,[N 3] who then pulled strings from behind his back, ruled in his name and dominated and demeaned him throughout his youth.

When the Urcheon of Erlenwald arrived in the castle and asked for the hand of Pavetta too, Rainfarn as many others pretenders, offended by that insult, attacked him and tried to kill him. Rainfarn nearly managed: he drew his hidden dagger and stabbed the Urcheon in the ribs, but when he was about to stab him again, the witcher Geralt, under the identity of Ravix of Fourhorn, disarmed him and hurt him with his sword. Although he was severely wounded in the events that happened that night, he did survive and returned to Attre.
After the Slaughter of Cintra, he fought for the North together with Prince Windhalm and Vissegerd but when even Attre was conquered by the Nilfgaardians and Windhalm was captured by the latters, Rainfarn accepted to cooperate with them, starting serving the Empire and wearing the colors of Nilfgaard, since his alternate choice was a painful death like Prince Windhalm.[1]

After the torture of both Aryan and Maria Louisa La Valette failed, Ravanen ordered a band of mercenaries to ambush a caravan with the royal bastards. The mercenaries never showed because Maravel, unaware of Kimbolt's attempt, diverted it, accidentally killing Boussy in the process.
When Geralt managed to reveal Maravel's betrayal to Nilfgaard, Constable John Natalis arrested him immediately. Provided that Geralt also revealed Baron Kimbolt's plan to kill Boussy, the witcher was awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service to Temeria but Kimbolt wasn't arrested as Natalis didn't have the manpower to command both men's units. However, with the new information he was able to blackmail the aristocrat into helping him out.
He also apparently ordered a Kimbolt Way to be constructed in Velen, directed towards Oxenfurt, meant to act as a safe escape route in case his plans to take power after his cousin's death went awry.[2]

Every member of the division had tied a bundle of hay to their right leg and one of straw to their left one; The reason for this bizarre practice was since all the members were mostly illiterate and ignorant farmers who didn't discern the left from the right, for the sergeant who trained the unit only had to simply say  "Straw, Hay, Straw..." instead of "Left, Right, Left..." during the marches.
The PFI took part in the Battle of Brenna under the command of the voivode Bronibor. Initially held in reserve, it was assigned to stop the counter-charge of the Nilfgaardian Nauzicaa and 7th Daerlan brigades. Consisting primarily of inexperienced pike-men matched against the enemy's cavalry the PFI sustained heavy casualties in the clash, Bronibor included. It did manifest a surprising valor however and managed to hold its ground.
The Infantry equipment included : Chain shirt, tabard, pike, helmet and dagger.

The sewers can be accessed from a few different places and in a couple of different ways. There are the main entrances: one from the Temple Quarter and one from the Trade Quarter. There is also a floor grate in the jail which leads to the sewers, and finally, beginning in Chapter III, one can now use a grate near the steps leading into the slums or directly teleport into the elven ruins.
You can travel between the Temple and Trade quarters by way of the network of sewers, but it is a dirty, smelly, monster-infested route — unless you like that sort of thing. It also hides a fisstech production laboratory which is run by the local drug lord, Gellert Bleinheim.

          <dd>Skjall was a Skellige warrior who lived in the village of Lofoten on Hindarsfjall with his mother and his sister, Astrid. One day, while he was gathering food along the shore, Ciri and the mysterious elf appeared out of nowhere, falling into the ocean near him. The elf carried a badly injured Ciri over to Skjall and asked for help, so Skjall took the two to Lofoten. He then took to watching over Ciri as she slept for almost a day while the elf went searching for a boat.
Once Ciri woke up, he informed her about the elf and how much time had passed before Astrid interrupted their conversation and, with Ciri desperate to get to the location the elf gave her, was sent off to ready a couple horses while Astrid took Ciri to the sauna to help her heal.
After Ciri finished up at the sauna and the two got ready to ride out, the Wild Hunt attacked the village and the two helped fight before making a run for the horses. Even though the villagers were in immediate danger, Skjall insisted on getting Ciri to the location to make sure she was safe before returning to the village. However, when he got Ciri to the elf, who was waiting with a boat, he watched as they appeared to argue before the elf used a spell to knock her out and get her on the boat. Seeing this, Skjall raced down to get to them but was knocked down from behind by the Wild Hunt as the boat left shore. Some time later, Skjall woke up long enough to see Uma before passing out once more.
When Geralt and Yennefer trace Ciri's steps to Lofoten, they learn that the elders, believing Skjall had fled the battle due to cowardliness, had branded him as Craven. To try and prove his worth and regain his name, he then set out to slay Morkvarg, but failed in this task and died from his wounds. Geralt finds his body and Yennefer reanimates it with the use of Necromancy in an attempt to learn what happened to Ciri on Skellige.
After Geralt is reunited with Ciri, she asks to return to Skellige to find Skjall's body and give him a proper burial so she can honor the young man that gave his life so she could live.

After the murder of his father, Stennis inherited a realm in chaos with peasant rebellions and feud with Henselt of Kaedwen for the Pontar Valley. Although nobody doubted the Prince's claim to the crown, his arrogance and youthful lack of experience proved trouble when looking for support of the influential families that he needed to actually be crowned. To demonstrate what a good monarch he could be, Stennis and a few noblemen loyal to him joined Saskia in Vergen.
If Geralt joins Roche: Unfortunately for him, his plan to ascend the throne of Aedirn came to a miserable end: when he, King Henselt and Saskia met to discuss on the future of Aedirn, a mysterious curse casted by Sabrina Glevissig many years before made all the corpses of Kaedweni and Aedirnian soldiers died in battle resurrect as wraiths, who soon started fighting against each other. Prince Stennis remained killed while trying to escape.
If Geralt accuses Stennis to be guilty: After the poisoning of Saskia, Stennis was considered by the inhabitants of Vergen the only suspect. In the end, his speech didn't convince the witcher Geralt of his innocence; the Prince ended up lynched by peasants in front of his own chambers.
If Geralt spares him from the mob: After the defeat of Kaedwenian Army, both the serfs and nobility deemed the Prince worthy of the crown and he returned to Vengerberg. Ascending to the throne as King Stennis I, he changed his ways and became sensitive to the hardship of his subjects. This won him the hearts of people who saw him as the hope of the nation. Stennis was also quickly recognized by other Northern monarchs who promptly agreed that he will make a good ruler.

Ciri came to be Geralt's ward after he invoked the Law of Surprise on Duny and Pavetta. Geralt demanded that which Duny already had, but did not know of. This, Geralt revealed, was Duny's child, carried, unknown to Duny but known to Geralt, by Pavetta. Highlighting the destiny of the relationship between Geralt and Ciri, he claims her a second time when he invokes the Law of Surprise on a traveling merchant he saves from monsters during a random encounter. The merchant is unaware that his wife has taken Ciri into their home as a war orphan.

Shaelmaars are completely blind and rely on an echolocation, a mechanism based on how sound waves bounce off potential obstacles, not unlike bats.[2] The existence of this large beast is also essential to giant centipedes, who consume shaelmaar droppings.[3][4]

During this time the country was ruled by Lady Bernika who took power after escaping from a mage tower in which she was imprisoned due to the suspicions of being afflicted with The Curse of the Black Sun. Her reign was rather strict - rumor had it that the most seen part of the Talgarian landscape were the gallows.[1]
In the far future, the weather has changed enough that northern regions, like Talgar, Caingorn, and Kaedwen, are no longer able to grow certain types of produce due to the colder climate.[2]

          <dd>Dungeons of La Valette Castle are located underground in the keep. They consist of a vast network of tunnels, infested with rats, droppings and human remains of those people who have lost their lives here. The tunnels branch out on two levels. In addition to cells, there is also a lower torture chamber and an interrogation room.
Other than regular criminals and thieves, political dissidents are captured and detained here. Recently, after the attack by King Foltest's army, the castle passed into the hands of Temerians, who imprisoned the rebels of the La Valettes and their allies. Among these are the Baroness Mary Louisa and her son Aryan.
Geralt of Rivia has also been held and handcuffed in one cell of the dungeons. At the beginning of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, the reason for his captivity is unknown until Vernon Roche enters the cell to question him.

They were led by Toruviel and had a relationship with the villagers that could at best be described as uneasy. They spent their days fishing or trying to heal their own sick and wounded.
One elf, in particular, stood guard outside the cave all day and night. Toruviel, Chireadan, the elven craftsman, and some other elves come out to the shore during the day and return to the cave at night. Because of the dire situation they found themselves in, the elves accepted any food, including wyvern meat and gutted fish.
They also had one elven sorceress among them which, despite a quite combative attitude, could be wooed by Geralt of Rivia if he gave the group food of some kind apart from bread.

          <dd>Dice poker once again makes an appearance as one of the mini-games in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. Due to its inherent reliance on sheer luck, it is not a good way of making money.
The game is essentially unchanged from The Witcher, except that you now must physically "roll" the dice and you have the possibility of losing one or more of them if they roll off the playing surface. The game now also takes one round only so there is more room for luck and less for tactics.
Compared to the first game, the camera angle at which the board is shown and the results of the rolled dice are more difficult to parse, making it more difficult to get a general overview of the situation. Another less than desirable change, the quick view of the current dice combinations for each player after the initial roll has been taken away resulting in a less accessible mini-game.
The gambling aspect is also weighted against the player; the most that Geralt can bet is 10 orens on the first round and another 10 on the second, however the opponent can potentially raise Geralt's initial bet by another 10 orens and his second bet by another 10 orens (which they will only do if they have a good hand), effectively meaning that the stakes are going to be higher when the opponent has a good hand than when Geralt has a good hand, so on average you stand to lose more than you gain, all other things being equal.
It is possible to save before starting playing and then save again if you win, but instead reload the save if you lose, thus only ever winning games. However, this is a very slow and tedious way of making orens.

Triss is the most serious of these, in the sense that there is an actual depth and continuation of this relationship.
All told, Geralt's intimate liaisons can involve Triss, Ves, the Succubus, Mottle, and prostitutes at either of the two brothels. As of the Enhanced Edition, there is also an opportunity for sex with Cynthia in Chapter III if (a) following Iorveth's path and (b) resolving The Secrets of Loc Muinne in a very specific way.

He is confronted by three mercenaries and can choose to use the Axii sign to defuse the situation to some extent by incapacitating one of the opponents, or fight them as is. If he does so, he wins 34.
In official fistfighting matches which are part of a regional tournament, Geralt cannot use any magic or weapons (however an initial Quen shield is still gained if you have the Protection Glyphword as an armour enchantment). In these brawls, he enters the ring shirtless, relying entirely on his strength and agility to pound his foes.

          <dd>In the Witcher series, the study of alchemy can create powerful offensive and defensive concoctions that can bring an advantage into battles. Alchemy isn't only used by witchers, but also by a sizable amount of the world's populace. By synthesizing herbs, monster parts, and other ingredients, Geralt can bolster his combat effectiveness. Alchemy's major strength is giving the player an edge in a specific encounter by increasing a certain stat or ability to match which fighting style is needed. Players can craft potions, oils, and bombs.

          <dd>Witchers utilize one-handed magic spells in combat called signs to help ward off dangerous threats. These magic spells can be used for offensive and defensive purposes and can help turn the tide in battle. Whether it's by channelling dangerous flames, a protective shield, or by controlling the minds of his enemies, Geralt never has his back against the wall.
All signs have four tiers of upgrades that are un-lockable. The next tier can be unlocked after sufficient ability points have been applied to upgrades in the preceding tier. Upgrades may have 2-5 possible levels with varying affects. All sign upgrades add +0.5/sec stamina regeneration in combat.
For all of the SIgns, if you unlock and equip their Alternate mode it is activated by holding down the Sign key instead of just tapping it.

          <dd>It features the world of The Witcher and allows players to assume the role of four different characters from the franchise. These characters include Geralt of Rivia, Dandelion, Triss Merigold, and Yarpen Zigrin. Players compete in various quests, slaying monsters along the way, in order to gain the most victory points.
Each of the four characters has their own skill set, so the player can experience the world of the Witcher differently depending on which character you choose. You are sure to find a character to fit your play style, whether you prefer diplomacy to fighting, or wielding magic to relying on the help of companions. The Witcher Adventure Game provides a multitude of tactical options.

          <dd>Are you frugal? Thrifty? Economical? A miser? A tightwad? All right, a cheapskate? Does that extend to your behavior when you play The Witcher? Well it does for me, so in keeping with that philosophy, here are a few tips on saving orens in the game. Also, in the game the trade-offs are usually between time and money, and since time seems to stretch infinitely, money is key. The tips are especially useful in the first 3 chapters (or acts). After that, you will have pretty much all the cash you need. You can also check out the price lists for more information.

Opponents can be found far and wide as it seems mercenaries took it with them to the farthest reaches of the kingdoms as they scattered after the war.

The easiest way to get these entries is to just read the book that contains the entries you need. If you are a cheapskate, then there is some added complexity to getting the entries you need with minimum cash outlay. If money is no object, just buy all the books you need. There is always a merchant selling books, no matter where you are (and buying the ones you have read).
Boss monsters do not require a pre-existing Bestiary entry to extract the special ingredients.

          <dd>Trophy quests begin when a head is removed from an exceptional monster's remains. There are ten of these quests in The Witcher, two in each chapter. They are all secondary, although completing the main plot will require beginning (not necessarily completing) The Beast of the Sewers.
Trophy heads can be redeemed whenever Geralt has access to the current chapter's "trophy official" (these are noted by chapter below). However, since you can only carry one at a time, turning them in as you get them is more efficient. (Up to patch 1.4, trophy heads could be stored at inns. It has been reported that since that patch, it may be possible.)
The target of a trophy quest is usually larger than others of its kind, but is primarily set apart by having a specific name.
Trophy heads do not seem to despawn if you drop them.

It was expected to be published in the fall of 2010. This release date was missed however and saw numerous edits. Gollancz, at the time, was criticized for missing the numerous release dates. This turn of events pushed Baptism of Fire further back.
Time of Contempt was first released in the UK on 27 June 2013 (published by Gollancz). A Kindle edition was released simultaneously. A second edition was released on 23 January 2014. A U.S. edition, The Time Of Contempt, was released by Orbit Books on 27 August 2013.

Its buildings are described as light, open on all sides (thus resembling gazebos or arbours), seeming so airy, delicate and ephemeral that they actually look not like buildings, but phantoms of buildings. They are built of marble, alabaster, and malachite, and adorned with stucco, terracotta, and mosaics. There are many bridges and terraces, peristiles, cloisters and balconies, sculptures and monuments.
According to Galahad, this land is known by people of his world and have various names: Faërie (by Britons), Annwn (by Celtic druids) or Elfland (by Saxons).

In his early years he was a contender for the hand of Princess Pavetta of Cintra, however, it never came to anything. After King Bran passed the throne to Eist Tuirseach, Crach became Jarl of Skellige, the main commander of the military forces. He also had a brief affair with Yennefer and remained fond of her afterward, which he demonstrated by helping her in her search for Vilgefortz in 1267.
He was known for sometimes showing his fiery temper as well as a healthy appetite. During his youth, he was described as a broad shouldered man with a mop of red hair. Later when he was a grown adult, his eyes were said to be hawk-like.

She was also extremely obsessive about her appearance and things in general. Tissaia was the one who took a young Yennefer of Vengerberg under her wing. It was she who fixed Yennefer's hunchback and cured her of her various afflictions. During the coup on Thanedd Island, it was she who teleported a heavily wounded Geralt and Triss away from the hands of the approaching Redanian army. After the coup on Thanedd Island, Tissaia committed suicide slitting her wrists. Together with the other losses, her death spelled the end of the Council, making way for the Lodge of Sorceresses.

Toussaint does not maintain a large standing army of its own, instead relying on a few regiments of knights-errant, watching the borders and roads[2][3] in conjunction with Ducal Guard.[4] Toussaint is also one of the few countries in the Continent which doesn't have a Secret Service.
Despite being a vassal state of Nilfgaard, Toussaint maintains high level of autonomy and the Nilfgaardian Empire does not tend to impose imperial authority on its internal affair or violate its borders for the most part.
While the duchy's surface may be fairy and serene, beneath the wine cellars it hides a gargantuan underground system of interconnecting ancient adits, mines and dungeons, as well as natural caverns and tunnels hollowed by lava, allegedly connected with the center of the earth.[3]

She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.

On Iorveth's path, in order to find Triss Merigold who has been kidnapped by the Kingslayer, Geralt must speak with the Troll of Vergen. The creature explains that he did find the sorceress after she fell from the sky. She was wounded and he tried to help her, but his jealous wife didn't appreciate the intruder, so she ran away leaving her husband. Geralt can choose to help the He-troll to find his woman and convince her to go back home. If he accepts, he finds the She-troll on a mountain in the southern area of Vergen, being attacked by Adam Pangratt and a group of his mercenaries. Geralt can decide to side with these men and kill the troll, or defend her and fight the mercenaries.
If Geralt decided to help both the trolls, at the end of Chapter II, the creatures will side Vergen defenders in the final battle with Henselt's army.
On Roche's path, Geralt and Vernon Roche meets the Troll of Vergen at the end of the Chapter, on the road for Vergen, after Geralt has dispatched the mist.
Note that there are 3 trolls on Iorveth's path that you need to leave be in order to get the Friend of Trolls achievement. If you take the Roche path, you will find 4 trolls, in addition to the three, there's another one hiding in a little cul de sac close to the brothel tent near the Kaedwani camp. His murder is not needed to get the Trollslayer achievement.

He also became the King of Cintra after marrying Cirilla in 1268.
His rule of Nilfgaard was highly aggressive, often pursuing expansionist policies similar to those of his predecessors. This led to the outbreak of two wars against the Northern Kingdoms, both of which he lost. Emhyr var Emreis was an intelligent and brilliant ruler. He chose his people well and crushed many plots against him. He was ruthless toward traitors and moved towards his goals with great determination.
He was publicly favorable to the Elder Races, in stark contrast to monarchs of the North.

After assuming the throne he granted nationwide amnesty, excluding the political prisoners. He also continued the conquests of neighboring lands in the North.

Settled priests usually follow a single deity but acknowledge and respect others[1] while the wandering ones tend to invoke all the gods.[2] Some of the deities are known as the Immortal Ones.[3]
It should be noted that while most of one deity's followers believe in the existence of another one, they do not necessarily worship the latter in the same way as the primary one – and, in extreme cases, can even hate it and its followers, as in case of the persecuted Coram Agh Tera cult.[4]

As with earlier games, the consequences of Geralt's actions will impact how the narrative progresses. The game has been built using the new REDengine 3 and was designed with player feedback from fans of previous Witcher games in mind.[9]
For fans of the series, the online event "Killing Monsters", a weekly giveaway of wallpapers and audio files that ran from 10 June 2013 to 14 August 2013, culminated in the release of the "Killing Monsters" cinematic trailer.
On 14 May 2015, CD Projekt RED (working with Digic Pictures) released a pre-launch short story trailer titled "A Night to Remember".
On September 4, 2020, it was announced that the game and its expansions would be getting a next-generation upgrade and would be released as a standalone purchase for the next-generation consoles (Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5) as well as PC. A free update will be given out to those who already own the game on the PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.[1] It's expected to be released in 2021.[2]

The two can fight it out, in which case Traut's remains contain the magical armor, an anti-Henselt pamplet, a key and some other loot

Then he started to spread the belief among soldiers, saying that Sabrina would protect them while in battle.
He has surrounded his hut with a circle of candles, which curiously keep monsters away. He claims that it is Sabrina's blessing, but most likely it is that creatures do not like the fish oil smell.
Talking with him, Geralt learns that the Visionary is the same soldier who speared Sabrina's body while she was on the stake, killing her. Unfortunately, this spear is lost.

The sewers can be accessed from a few different places and in a couple of different ways. There are the main entrances: one from the Temple Quarter and one from the Trade Quarter. There is also a floor grate in the jail which leads to the sewers, and finally, beginning in Chapter III, one can now use a grate near the steps leading into the slums or directly teleport into the elven ruins.
You can travel between the Temple and Trade quarters by way of the network of sewers, but it is a dirty, smelly, monster-infested route — unless you like that sort of thing. It also hides a fisstech production laboratory which is run by the local drug lord, Gellert Bleinheim.

          <dd>Werebears,[1] on Skellige known as berserkers,[2] are therianthropes who transform into bears or half-bears. As other such creatures, they are hardly hurt by steel but are still very vulnerable to silver.
Like other kinds of therianthropy, the "arctanthropy" can be acquired either as a result of a curse or inherited from werebear parents. However, it is likely that a bite from a werebear does not result in the victim becoming a werebear as well.[1][3][4] That said, on the Skellige Isles, a group of Svalblod worshipers called Vildkaarls invented another, "controllable" way of becoming a berserker. After a complicated ritual involving psilocybe mushrooms and what seemed to be allowing wild bears to eat the cultists alive, the fierce warriors used to rise and spill blood in the name of their god.
The bloodlust of Svalblod worshipers and their leader, jarl Knut the Callous, ultimately led the Islanders to banish the cult and destroy the sacred sites of the werebear god.[2][5]
Werebears are exceptionally strong, even tougher and more relentless than real bears.[2] It is possible that they enjoy the company of ursines, such as werewolves stick to canines, werecats to felids and wererats to murids.[3][4]

          <dd>Werecats are therianthropes who transform into cats or half-cats.[1] As other such creatures, they are hardly hurt by steel but very vulnerable to silver.
There are two most common ways to aquire ailuranthropy: the first one through a curse[2] and the second is to simply have a werecat parent.[1][3] Being bitten by another werecat, while popular in folk tales, gives only a very small chance of becoming one in reality.[2] Those who are born as werecats are able to fully control their shapeshifting abilities,[1][3] while those cursed or bitten change into their werecat form only during the full moon.[2] Those who became werecats during their lives however are the only ones who can be cured.[3]
Therianthropy diseases, including ailuranthropy, appeared in the world after the Conjunction of the Spheres, affecting nonhuman and early human populations alike.[2] In Creigiau, the local noble family carried the ailuranthropic gene for generations; attempts at hiding their secret resulted in creation of local cult of Leshy believed by folk to haunt the forests in its cat form.[3]
Werecats have a good night vision, slightly better than those of real cats. They find faithful companions in other felids, either domestic ones[2] or wild such as pumas or lynxes.[3] As one would expect, they are hostile towards werewolves and wererats.

Therianthropy diseases, including lycanthropy, appeared in the world after the Conjunction of the Spheres, affecting nonhuman and early human populations alike.[2] According to Herbolth, lands in the Toina valley, also called the Dogbane, were plagued by werewolves before the Nordling colonization.[4]
Werewolves have a legendary sense of smell, exceptional even amongst real wolves.[1] Lycanthropes are usually on good terms with other canines and, as one would expect, hate werecats.[2]

The apocalypse could not be prevented, neither by mages, Aen Saevherne, nor even Ciri.

Talking with him, Geralt learns that the Visionary is the same soldier who speared Sabrina's body while she was on the stake, killing her. Unfortunately, this spear is lost.

The zeugl is paralyzingly hideous, foul-smelling, and surprisingly strong for something resembling a rotten potato, so it usually manages to devour its opponent.[1][2]
Geralt was hired to rid the sewers of a zeugl during his and Yennefer's stay in Aedd Gynvael.[1] There is also a breed of zeugl mutated by Rissberg mages called parazeugl, which in turn is not at all dangerous and cleans the sewers.[3]
